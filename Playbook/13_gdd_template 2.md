## 1. Title Page

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Game Title** | [___] |
| **Subtitle / Tagline** | [___] |
| **Document Version** | [___] *e.g., 0.1 — First Draft* |
| **Author(s)** | [___] |
| **Date** | [___] |
| **Genre** | [___] *e.g., Action-Platformer, Top-Down RPG, Roguelite Shooter* |

### Revision History

| Version | Date | Author | Changes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | [___] | [___] | Initial draft |

---

## 2. Vision Statement

### Elevator Pitch (2-3 sentences)

[___]

*Example: "A hand-drawn metroidvania where you play as a lighthouse keeper exploring a sunken city beneath the waves. Tight combat meets environmental puzzle-solving as you restore light to forgotten places. Think Hollow Knight meets Spiritfarer."*

### The "X meets Y" Formula

**[___]** meets **[___]** with a twist of **[___]**

*This isn't reductive — it's communicative. It tells collaborators, publishers, and players what experience to expect. Pick references that capture different aspects: one for mechanics, one for tone/feel.*

### Core Fantasy

What does the player get to *feel* or *be*?

[___]

*Example: "You are the last cartographer in a world that's forgetting itself. You feel like an explorer reclaiming lost knowledge, piecing together a map that literally reshapes reality."*

### What Makes This Unique?

What's the one thing no other game does quite like yours?

[___]

*If you can't answer this in one sentence, keep refining until you can. This is your hook.*

> **🪞 Ask yourself:**
> - If I describe this game without using its genre, is it still interesting?
> - Would I be excited to play this if someone else made it?
> - Can I explain why someone should play *this* instead of [closest competitor]?

## 3. Design Pillars

Design pillars are 3-5 principles that guide every decision. When you're unsure whether a feature belongs, run it through your pillars. If it doesn't serve at least one, cut it.

| # | Pillar | What It Means in Practice |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | [___] | [___] |
| 2 | [___] | [___] |
| 3 | [___] | [___] |
| 4 | [___] | [___] |
| 5 | [___] | [___] |

*Examples:*
- *"**Readable in a Glance** — The player should always understand the game state within 1 second of looking at the screen. No clutter."*
- *"**Earned Mastery** — Progression comes from player skill, not stat inflation. A new player with perfect execution beats a veteran with bad habits."*
- *"**Cozy Danger** — The world is hostile but never cruel. Death is a setback, not a punishment. The tone stays warm even when stakes are high."*
- *"**Every Run Tells a Story** — Procedural elements combine to create memorable, shareable moments. No two runs feel the same."*
- *"**Juice Everything** — Every action has feedback. Screen shake, particles, sound, animation. If it doesn't feel good to press the button, it's not done."*

> **🪞 Ask yourself:**
> - If a team member proposes a feature, can I use these pillars to say yes or no?
> - Do any of my pillars contradict each other? (That's okay — creative tension is useful, but be aware of it.)
> - Are these specific to *my* game, or could they describe any game? (If they're generic, sharpen them.)

## 4. Game Overview

### Quick Facts

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Primary Genre** | [___] |
| **Secondary Genre(s)** | [___] |
| **Camera / Perspective** | [___] *e.g., Side-scrolling, Top-down, Isometric, Fixed-screen* |
| **Art Style** | [___] *e.g., Pixel art 16-bit, Hand-drawn, Vector, Low-poly 2D* |
| **Tone / Mood** | [___] *e.g., Whimsical, Dark & oppressive, Chill & meditative* |
| **Target Audience** | [___] *Who is this for? Be specific. Age, gaming habits, taste.* |
| **Typical Play Session** | [___] *e.g., 15-30 minute runs, 1-2 hour sessions* |
| **Total Playtime (Main Path)** | [___] *e.g., 8-12 hours* |
| **Total Playtime (Completionist)** | [___] *e.g., 25-40 hours* |
| **Replayability** | [___] *None / Low / Medium / High — and why* |

### Comparable Titles

List 3-5 games and what you're taking from each:

| Game | What You're Borrowing |
|---|---|
| [___] | [___] *e.g., "Celeste — tight movement feel, assist mode philosophy"* |
| [___] | [___] |
| [___] | [___] |
| [___] | [___] |
| [___] | [___] |

*These aren't clones — they're touchstones. You're building a constellation of influences, not copying a star.*

> **🪞 Ask yourself:**
> - Can I describe my target player as a real person? ("Alex, 28, plays indie games on Steam Deck during commute, loves Hades, bounced off Elden Ring")
> - Is my estimated playtime realistic for my scope? (Solo dev rule of thumb: every hour of content takes 40-100 hours to build.)

---

## 5. Core Gameplay Loop

> *See [E6 — Game Design Fundamentals](../E/E6_game_design_fundamentals.md) for loop theory and pacing concepts.*

### The Three Loops

**Moment-to-Moment (every ~10 seconds):**

[___]

*Example: "See enemy → dodge attack → counter → collect drop. The core verb chain is: move, dodge, strike, loot."*

**Session Loop (every ~10 minutes):**

[___]

*Example: "Explore room cluster → find key item → unlock new path → reach checkpoint. Each 'floor' is a self-contained challenge arc."*

**Meta Loop (every ~1 hour / across sessions):**

[___]

*Example: "Complete a run → spend currency on permanent upgrades → unlock new weapon class → start new run with expanded options."*

### Loop Diagram

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   META LOOP                      │

### Core Verbs

What does the player *do*? List the primary actions:

| Verb | Input | Frequency | Feel Target |
|---|---|---|---|
| [___] | [___] | [___] | [___] |
| [___] | [___] | [___] | [___] |
| [___] | [___] | [___] | [___] |
| [___] | [___] | [___] | [___] |

*e.g., "Jump — A button — Constant — Snappy, responsive, 2-frame coyote time"*

> **🪞 Ask yourself:**
> - Is my moment-to-moment loop fun on its own, even without progression or story?
> - Does the session loop provide satisfying "arcs" — rising tension and release?
> - Does the meta loop give me a reason to come back tomorrow?

---

## 6. Mechanics

### Skill Tree / Upgrade Paths

*If applicable. Describe the structure:*

[___]

*Is it a tree (branching, exclusive choices), a web (interconnected), a list (linear unlocks), or freeform?*

> **🪞 Ask yourself:**
> - Does the player feel more powerful at the end than the beginning? How specifically?
> - Are there meaningful choices, or is there one "correct" build?
> - Can a player who skips optional progression still finish the game?

> **🪞 Ask yourself:**
> - Does my narrative serve the gameplay, or compete with it?
> - Can a player skip/ignore the story and still enjoy the game?
> - Am I writing a novel or making a game? (Both is fine — just be intentional.)

## Using This Document

**This GDD is a living document.** Update it as your game evolves. Some sections will be sparse early on and fill in over production. That's normal.

**How to work with it:**

1. **Pre-production:** Fill out Sections 1-5 completely. Sketch 6-9. Leave 14-15 rough.
2. **Prototype phase:** Refine Section 6 (Mechanics) as you playtest. Update 7-8 with real data.
3. **Production:** Sections 8-13 become your source of truth. Track scope in Section 14.
4. **Pre-launch:** Section 15 becomes critical. Start marketing *before* the game is done.

**When in doubt, check your Design Pillars (Section 3).** They're your compass.
